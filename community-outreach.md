## Biodiversity Collections Event

The <a href="biodiversity.uconn.edu" target="_blank">UConn Biodiversity Collections</a> organized an outreach event in November 2022.

Students, faculty, and staff created conifer-living animal ornaments out of felt. These ornaments were hung on a Christmas tree and displayed as part of an outreach effort to get the community engaged with learning about animals that live in conifers and why conifers are ecologically important.

## Bug Week Outreach

As a part of the "bug week" outreach event hosted by the collections department in 2022, the <a href="knutielab.com" target="_blank">Knutie Lab</a> organized a table where people of all ages could learn about nest parasites or box nesting birds. There was a plushie parasite "nest" where kids could fill out a "field notes" sheet based on what they saw, a coloring sheet, and information about joining the lab's community science project as a nest box landlord.
