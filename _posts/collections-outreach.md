## Conifer Outreach Event

These photos are from an outreach event hosted by the UConn Biodiversity Collections.

Students, faculty, and staff created conifer-living animal ornaments out of felt. These ornaments were hung on a Christmas tree and displayed as part of an outreach effort to get the community engaged with learning about animals that live in conifers and why conifers are ecologically important.
